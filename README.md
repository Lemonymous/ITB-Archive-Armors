# ITB-Archive-Armors
 Archive Armors is a mod for Into the Breach, adding a single playable squad to the game.
 Even if the squad is not enabled, an option can be toggled to allow the units' weapons to be added to the store.

# Requirements
 In order for the mod to function you will need to install kartoFlane's mod loader first. It can be found here: https://github.com/kartoFlane/ITB-ModLoader
 Follow the instructions provided there before proceeding to install this mod.

# Install
 Installing the mod is as simple as dropping the folder `Archive Armors` into your game's `mods` folder.

 To be clear: that is `Archive Armors`, **not** `ITB-Archive-Armors`

 Correct folder structure should look like this: `../Into the Breach/mods/Archive Armors/`
 
 To enable the squad: Open ITB -> Mod Content -> Edit Squads -> Disable one of the vanilla squads -> Enable Archive Armors
